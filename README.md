# Attention & Context Controllers  
_From Memory Systems to Cognitive Control_

This project explores **Attention and Context Controllers** for AI agents.

If memory answers:

> What does the system know?

Then attention answers:

> What matters right now?

And context answers:

> Why does it matter?

Most AI agents today:
- Retrieve too much
- Reason without prioritization
- Treat all signals equally
- Fail under overload
- Drift off-task

This repository builds a **control layer above memory**, enabling agents to:
- Dynamically focus
- Allocate cognitive budget
- Shift temporal modes
- Detect drift
- Respond to interruption
- Modulate reasoning depth

This is not about bigger models.  
This is about better control.

## Why This Project Exists

Modern agent stacks often include:
- Tool use
- Memory retrieval
- Planning loops
- Multi-agent communication

But they lack an explicit **attention system**.

Without attention:
- Memory becomes noise
- Planning becomes expensive
- Multi-agent coordination becomes chaotic
- Long-horizon tasks degrade

Attention is the gatekeeper of cognition.

This repository implements it explicitly.
